# DesignSpaceEditor

An **experimental** RoboFont extension to create and edit designspace files. If you want a **preview**, **measuring tools**, more than **5 axes** and a **nice graphic** representation of the design space, have a look at [Superpolator](http://new.superpolator.com/home/order/).

* Open, edit and save existing designspace files.
* Start new designspace files.
* Open master UFOs
* The window does not behave like a document yet. The save button is clumsy at the moment.
* Some new elements in the designspace that are not yet part of MutatorMath.
* Should be compatible with **MutatorMath** and **FontTools.varlib**.

## Usage
1. Add some axes first. 
2. Then load some masters.
3. Then save the document in the same folder as your masters, or one level up. The document will store a relative path to the masters and instances.
4. Define instances and whatever else you need to do.
5. Save.

## Axes
* Use the `+` button to create a new axis.
* Rename the axis to what you need. If you type one of the registered OpenType axis names (*weight*, *width*, *optical*, *slant* or *italic*, all lowercase) the tag will be filled in automatically and a comforting `âœ“` appears next to the axis name to indicate this is indeed a standard axis.
* Minimum value, maximum value are the boundaries of the axis.
* Default is the default value on the axis for new instances.
* For unregistered axes you'll be able to add a *labelname*. This name is intended for user-facing UI labeling. It will use `xml:lang="en"` for these entries. This field is not yet fully supported in the varlib tools.
* You can rename the axis name in the list, but you can't change it to an existing name.

## Masters
* Use the `+` button to add masters: a file dialog will appear and you can select a UFO.
* Use the `-` button to remove a master. A dialog will appear to make sure.
* Use the `Open` button to open the selected UFOs in RoboFont. Instant editing!
* Select a single master to see its file path.
* In the toolbar, use the `Add Open Fonts` button to add all open fonts at once. 
* If the masters can be found then a `âœ“` appears next to the name.
* Use the `Make Default` button to make the selected master the default: it sets the **lib**, **groups** and **info** flags for this master. The ðŸ”¹indicates the current default.
* Use the `Load Names` button to load the **family name** and **style name** from the UFO.

## Instances
* After adding two or more masters you can add instances using the `+` button.
* Remove selected instances with the `-` button. Again, a dialog will appear to make sure.
* Add a family name and a style name for the instance.
* Add axis values.
* A proposed UFO name will appear. This can't be edited at the moment.
* Use the `Duplicate` button to duplicate a selected instance.

## Report
* This panel shows a very basic validation report of what needs to be done and where the UFOs are, etc.

## Notes
* This extension uses the [DesignSpaceDocument](https://github.com/LettError/designSpaceDocument) reader and writer.
* The editor does not support **anisotropic** designspace locations (variable fonts don't either). If you open a file with an anisotropic coordinate (for instance exported from Superpolator) only the horizontal value will be used.
* The editor does

## Todo
* Separate validation for MutatorMath and Varlib use.
* Maybe a teensy preview.
