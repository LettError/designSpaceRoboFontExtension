# DesignSpaceEditor

An **experimental** RoboFont extension to create and edit designspace files.

* open, edit and save existing files
* start new files
* The window does not behave like a document yet. The save button is clumsy at the moment.
* Some new elements in the designspace that are not yet part of MutatorMath.

## Notes
* This extension contains some code that will be published as a separate module.
* This uses the [DesignSpaceDocument](https://github.com/LettError/designSpaceDocument) reader and writer.
* A (older) description on the [DesignSpaceDocument](https://github.com/LettError/MutatorMath/blob/master/Docs/designSpaceFileFormat.md) at the [MutatorMath repository](https://github.com/LettError/MutatorMath).
